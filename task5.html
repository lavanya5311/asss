     <P>The Shih Tzu is a sturdy little dog with a small muzzle and normally has large dark brown eyes. The Chinese have described their head shapes as "owl head" and "lion head", and their mouth as "frog mouths".[4] They have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A Shih Tzu should stand no more than 26.7 cm (101‚ÅÑ2") at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5kg (9 to 17 lb). Their floppy ears are covered with long fur, and their heavily fur-covered tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may be of any colour, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard.</P>

    <p>The Labrador Retriever, or simply Labrador, is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the European world.</p>
